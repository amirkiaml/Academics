# Academics
This repository is dedicated to my academic life, mainly for the purpose of showcasing some of the major transferrable projects that I have acquired in over 12 years of living in academia, from undergraduate to PhD. Some of these skills are as follows: **analytical thinking**, **time management**, **project management**, **advanced quantitative and qualitative reasoning** and **research skills**.

## Undergraduate
I did my undergraduate in **Mathematics and Applications** at *Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)* in Iran. While my focus and final thesis was on mathematical logics, I had deep exposure to various pure and applied mathematics subjects, mostly in terms of coursework.

Among these are the following topics, for each one or more course was taken:
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Calculus, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis
- Differential Equations
- Euclidean, Differential, Manifold and Algebraic Geometry
- Logic, Set Theory, Model Theory, Category Theory

My thesis was one an advanced topic in the crossovers of category theory and modal logics: coalgebraic logics. My thesis, titled *Logics for Coalgebras, and a Final Coalgebra Theorem* (written in Persian) can be found [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Logics-For-Coalgebras-and-a-Final-Coalgebra-Theorem.pdf).

Aside from perseverance and responsibility, some major skills that I acquired during my bachelor's program were advanced quantitative and logical reasoning as a result of engaging with various forms of mathematical concepts.

My mathematics background has always nourished my life, in our outside of academia. My master's and PhD degrees both built on top of this foundation and incorporated cutting-edge mathematical techniques in my research -- I will say more about these below. As for my data science endeavors, I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science* -- which is available on Amazon for purchasing (see [here](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/) for links). I also own and run a blog on the same subject: [mathanddata.com](https://mathanddata.com).
