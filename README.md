## Undergraduate
I did my undergraduate in **Mathematics and Applications** at *Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)* in Iran. While my focus and final thesis was on mathematical logics, I had deep exposure to various pure and applied mathematics subjects, mostly in terms of coursework.

Among these are the following topics, for each one or more course taken:
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Calculus, Real Analysis and Complex Analysis
- Differential Equations
- Euclidean, Differential, Manifold and Algebraic Geometry
- Logic, Set Theory, Model Theory and Category Theory

My thesis was one an advanced topic in the crossovers of category theory and modal logics: coalgebraic logics. My thesis, titled *Logics for Coalgebras, and a Final Coalgebra Theorem* (written in Persian) can be found [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Logics-For-Coalgebras-and-a-Final-Coalgebra-Theorem.pdf).

Some major skills that I acquired during my bachelor's program were as follows:
- **perseverance** and **responsibility**,
- **analytical thinking**,
- **quantitative reasoning**.

My mathematics background has always nourished my life, in our outside of academia. My master's and PhD degrees both built on top of this foundation and incorporated cutting-edge mathematical techniques in my research -- I will say more about these below. As for my data science endeavors, I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science* -- which is available on Amazon for purchasing (see [here](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/) for links). I also own and run a blog on the same subject: [mathanddata.com](https://mathanddata.com).

## Master's Degree
After years of exposure to various kinds of mathematical logic in my undergraduate years, I grew interested in the philosophical ideas behind math and logic. I decided to do my MA in Philosophy. I applied for the MA program in Philosophy at Tartu University in Estonia and was awarded several scholarships to pursue my dreams for a period of two years.

The program was research-intensive, but some of the courses that I took:

- Philosophy of AI
- Philosophy of Language
- Linguistic Semantics
- Philosophy of Mind
- Animal Consciousness
- Epistemology
- Metaphysics

I also had a chance to teach a graduate-level logic course, focused on modern modal logics and their semantics, to over 10 master's and PhD students from various disciplines (philosophy, mathematics and semiotics). You can find the course syllabus [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Course-Description.pdf).

In my MA thesis, titled *Perception, Abductive Methodology, and Compositional Universalism*, I proposed a few arguments for a major argument in metaphysics -- *compositional universalism* -- according to which any plurality of objects constitutes an object. You can find my MA thesis [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/MA-Thesis.pdf).

Among others, the main skills that I obtained or improved upon during my MA studies include:
- **analytical thinking**,
- **research**,
- **communication**.

## PhD

After I successfully finished my MA program in Philosophy, I decided to continue exploring the frontiers of philosophical thinking by pursuing a PhD in the field. Throughout the 4 years of my studies at the University of Calgary, I had the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research in Logic and Metaphysics. My research particularly focused on questions of fundamentality and how we can harness advanced mathematical and logical tools to address them. My dissertation can be found [here](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/items/5e063fbe-91e5-4932-88f8-16423030d5e3). For other papers and manuscripts, check out [here](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/amirhossein-kiani).

During my PhD, I also had a chance to learn and teach a diverse range of material on philosophical and ethical questions associated with AI, IT and Data. This has now contributed to my better understanding of recent debates on AI safety and various ethical concern around the topic. I'm currently running a [Medium blog](https://philanddata.medium.com/) that is focused on these topics. I also sometimes write voluntary content on the subject for non-for-profit organizations such as the [Centre for Social Impact Technology](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/); see [here](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/2023/04/13/data-citizenship-at-large-and-in-alberta/?fbclid=IwAR2wYqHlgJ_4It3ZW0JL_zVe_qr7n4OmSqDXOQ5mUvbJ_jdI6eO-s5Ku6bk) as a sample.

Most recently, I participated in a 24-hour hackathon hosted by **Google** and **BrainStation**, where we were asked to envision new ideas to educate users about AI-powered Google products while ensuring user trust and avoiding misunderstandings. Thanks to our amazing team, we were announced as the winner üèÜ of the contest.  Our initial focus was to understand the key reasons behind the general population's mistrust in the use of AI. Through extensive research, we identified three significant factors contributing to this mistrust: the lack of transparency, concerns about privacy invasion, and the difficulty in establishing ground truth for evaluating AI algorithm results in products. Addressing these concerns is pivotal in building trust and confidence in AI technologies. 

As a result, we introduced "Insights," a powerful widget integrated into the Google platform. "Insights" leverages the recent breakthrough in large language models to provide users with a unique glimpse behind the curtain, offering clear explanations of how AI enhances their experience, utilizes their data, and delivers the results they receive. With "Insights," we aim to foster transparency and empower users to confidently embrace AI-related features. To learn more about "Insights," check out the project's [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/Google-Industry-Day).

Some of the major skills that I have acquired and reinforced throughout my PhD are as follows, all at very advanced levels: 
- **analytical thinking**,
- **research**,
- **communication**,
- **team-working**,
- **mentoring**,
- **time management**,
- **project management**.

## Data Science

Finally, we get to the space where I am now: Data Science. In May 2023, I decided to join the online bootcamp in Data Science offered by BrainStation. This has been an incredible journey, and certainly a significant transition from academia. I have had the chance to learn various technical and soft skills and leverage the ones that I had acquired in my academic career, in this journey. 

This bootcamp has added much more to my Data Science toolkit, building on top of the contributions that, as I mentioned above, I kickstarted before joining the bootcamp: [my book on the mathematics of data science](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/), and [my dedicated blog on the subject](https://mathanddata.com) 

In my capstone project for the bootcamp -- titled *DeepChef* -- I harness the power of state-of-the-art large langue models and semantic embeddings to create a recommender system that takes in users' favorite recipes -- ingredients or instructions, along with themes or other elements -- and returns the 5-most similar recipes from a dataset of over 520,000 recipes scraped from [food.com](food.com). Another recommender system further enhances this by taking into account nutritional facts about recipes as well.

I'm currently at the final stages of this project, and hoping to be able to incorporate all the codes into a user-friendly app that people can use at their convenience. To follow the most recent updates on DeepChef, follow [this repository](https://github.com/amirkiaml/DeepChef-BSTN-Capstone).

Among various soft skills that I've had the opportunity to exercise or learn in my data science journey, here are some technical skills that I have acquired:

- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Programming:** Python, R, Bash,
- **Statistics:** Hypothesis Testing, A/B tests, Regression
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
- **Neural Networks:** Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Cloud:** GCP Leader , AWS
- **NLP:** NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, HuggingFace, Transformers
