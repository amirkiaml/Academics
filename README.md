# Educational Background
This repository is dedicated to my academic background, mainly for the purpose of telling my story and showcasing some of the major skills that I have acquired in over 12 years of living in academia, from undergraduate to PhD, plus my recent transition to data science. In short, some of these skills are as follows: <br><br>
    
- `analytical thinking`
-  `time management`
-  `project management`
-  `quantitative reasoning`
-  `qualitative reasoning`
-  `research`

## Undergraduate
  
I did my undergraduate in **Mathematics and Applications** at *Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)* in Iran. While my focus and final thesis was on mathematical logics, I had deep exposure to various pure and applied mathematics subjects, mostly in terms of coursework.

### Coursework
Among these are the following topics, for each one or more courses taken:
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Calculus, Real Analysis and Complex Analysis
- Differential Equations
- Euclidean, Differential, Manifold and Algebraic Geometry
- Logic, Set Theory, Model Theory and Category Theory

### Research
My thesis was on an advanced topic in the crossovers of category theory and modal logics: coalgebraic logics. My thesis, titled *Logics for Coalgebras, and a Final Coalgebra Theorem* (written in Persian) can be found [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Logics-For-Coalgebras-and-a-Final-Coalgebra-Theorem.pdf).

### Skills
Some major skills that I acquired during my bachelor's program were as follows:

- `perseverance` and `responsibility`
- `analytical thinking`
- `quantitative reasoning`

My mathematics background has always nourished my life, in our outside of academia. My master's and PhD degrees both built on top of this foundation and incorporated cutting-edge mathematical techniques in my research -- I will say more about these below. As for my data science endeavors, I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science* -- which is available on Amazon for purchasing (see [here](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/) for links). I also own and run a blog on the same subject: [mathanddata.com](https://mathanddata.com).



## Master's Degree
  
After years of exposure to various kinds of mathematical logic in my undergraduate years, I grew interested in the philosophical ideas behind math and logic. I decided to do my MA in Philosophy. I applied for the MA program in Philosophy at Tartu University in Estonia and was awarded several scholarships to pursue my dreams for a period of two years.

### Coursework
The program was research-intensive, but some of the courses that I took:

- Philosophy of AI
- Philosophy of Language
- Linguistic Semantics
- Philosophy of Mind
- Animal Consciousness
- Epistemology
- Metaphysics

### Research
In my MA thesis, titled *Perception, Abductive Methodology, and Compositional Universalism*, I proposed a few arguments for a major argument in metaphysics -- *compositional universalism* -- according to which any plurality of objects constitutes an object. You can find my MA thesis [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/MA-Thesis.pdf).

I was the only MA student to collaborate with 6 philosophers in a highly sought-after [research project](https://philexpertise.weebly.com/people.html) on the nature of controversy in philosophical debates, leading to several high-impact publications in leading journals.

### Teaching
I had a chance to teach a graduate-level logic [course](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Course-Description.pdf), focused on modern modal logics and their semantics, to over 10 masters and PhD students from various disciplines (philosophy, mathematics and semiotics). 

### Awards
During my MA program, I was awarded several scholarships, worth over $24,000; some of them are as follows:

- The *Best MA Thesis Prospectus of The Year* Award, Department of Philosophy, University of Tartu 2018
- *Tuition Waiver* Scholarship, University of Tartu (CA$6300/Year) 2017 & 2018
- *DoraPlus* Scholarship, University of Tartu (CA$5700/Year) 2017 & 2018
- *Achievement Stipend*, University of Tartu 2018
- *Excellence Scholarship* for Travel and Accommodation, University of Tartu

### Skills
Among others, the main skills that I obtained or improved upon during my MA studies include:
- `analytical thinking`
- `research`
- `communication`

## PhD
  
After I successfully finished my MA program in Philosophy, I decided to continue exploring the frontiers of philosophical thinking by pursuing a PhD in the field. Throughout the 4 years of my studies at the University of Calgary, I had the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research in Logic and Metaphysics.

### Research

During my PhD, my research particularly focused on questions of fundamentality and how we can harness advanced mathematical and logical tools to address them. My secondary research interest, which I'm still using in my current efforts, has to do with IT Ethics, AI safety, and machine consciousness. My dissertation can be found [here](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/items/5e063fbe-91e5-4932-88f8-16423030d5e3). One of the chapters of my dissertation was recently [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04114-5) in a leading journal in the field. For my other papers and manuscripts, check out [here](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/amirhossein-kiani).


### Teaching
During my PhD, I also had a chance to learn and teach hundreds of students, as the main instructor or in collaboration with others, a diverse range of material on philosophical and ethical questions associated with AI, IT and Data. This has now contributed to my better understanding of recent debates on AI safety and various ethical concern around the topic. I'm currently running a [Medium blog](https://philanddata.medium.com/) that is focused on these topics. I also sometimes write voluntary content on the subject for non-for-profit organizations such as the [Centre for Social Impact Technology](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/); see [here](https://centreforsocialimpacttech.ca/2023/04/13/data-citizenship-at-large-and-in-alberta/?fbclid=IwAR2wYqHlgJ_4It3ZW0JL_zVe_qr7n4OmSqDXOQ5mUvbJ_jdI6eO-s5Ku6bk) as a sample.

### Awards
During my PhD, I was awarded several prestigious scholarships, worth over $50,000; some of them are as follows:
- Alberta Graduate Excellence Scholarship (AGES) - International (CA$15000) 2021
- Department of Philosophy Graduate Essay Award (CA$2500) 2021
- Alberta Graduate Excellence Scholarship (AGES) - International (CA$15000) 2019
- Full Funding Package (4 years) - CA$30000/Year 2019-2023

### Skills

Some of the major skills that I have acquired and reinforced throughout my PhD are as follows, all at very advanced levels: 
- `analytical thinking`
- `research`
- `communication`
- `team-working`
- `mentoring`
- `time management`
- `project management`
