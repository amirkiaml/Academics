# Academics
This repository is dedicated to my academic life, mainly for the purpose of showcasing some of the major transferrable projects that I have acquired in over 12 years of living in academia, from undergraduate to PhD. Some of these skills are as follows: **analytical thinking**, **time management**, **project management**, **advanced quantitative and qualitative reasoning** and **research skills**.

## Undergraduate
I did my undergraduate in **Mathematics and Applications** at *Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)* in Iran. While my focus and final thesis was on mathematical logics, I had deep exposure to various pure and applied mathematics subjects, mostly in terms of coursework.

Among these are the following topics, for each one or more course taken:
- Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Abstract Algebra
- Calculus, Real Analysis and Complex Analysis
- Differential Equations
- Euclidean, Differential, Manifold and Algebraic Geometry
- Logic, Set Theory, Model Theory and Category Theory

My thesis was one an advanced topic in the crossovers of category theory and modal logics: coalgebraic logics. My thesis, titled *Logics for Coalgebras, and a Final Coalgebra Theorem* (written in Persian) can be found [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Logics-For-Coalgebras-and-a-Final-Coalgebra-Theorem.pdf).

Aside from perseverance and responsibility, some major skills that I acquired during my bachelor's program were advanced quantitative and logical reasoning as a result of engaging with various forms of mathematical concepts.

My mathematics background has always nourished my life, in our outside of academia. My master's and PhD degrees both built on top of this foundation and incorporated cutting-edge mathematical techniques in my research -- I will say more about these below. As for my data science endeavors, I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science* -- which is available on Amazon for purchasing (see [here](https://mathanddata.com/bookstore/) for links). I also own and run a blog on the same subject: [mathanddata.com](https://mathanddata.com).

## Master's Degree
After years of exposure to various kinds of mathematical logic in my undergraduate years, I grew interested in the philosophical ideas behind math and logic. I decided to do my MA in Philosophy. I applied for the MA program in Philosophy at Tartu University in Estonia and was awarded several scholarships to pursue my dreams for a period of two years.

The program was research-intensive, but some of the courses that I took:

- Philosophy of AI
- Philosophy of Language
- Linguistic Semantics
- Philosophy of Mind
- Animal Consciousness
- Epistemology
- Metaphysics

I also had a chance to teach a graduate-level logic course, focused on modern modal logics and their semantics, to over 10 master's and PhD students from various disciplines (philosophy, mathematics and semiotics). You can find the course syllabus [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/Course-Description.pdf).

In my MA thesis, titled *Perception, Abductive Methodology, and Compositional Universalism*, I proposed a few arguments for a major argument in metaphysics -- *compositional universalism* -- according to which any plurality of objects constitutes an object. You can find my MA thesis [here](http://amirkiani.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2020/10/MA-Thesis.pdf).

Among others, the main skills that I obtained or improved upon during my MA studies include **analytical thinking**, **research**, and **communication**.
